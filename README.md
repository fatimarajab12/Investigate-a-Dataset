Investigate-a-Dataset Project
Overview
This project investigates a dataset using Python in a Jupyter notebook. It includes data exploration, cleaning, and analysis, with the results presented in an interactive notebook. The project aims to provide insights and visualizations from the data using different Python libraries.

Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following tools and libraries installed:

Python (version 3.x)
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
Required Python Libraries:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn (if any machine learning tasks are involved)
You can install the required libraries using the following:

bash
نسخ الكود
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
Setup Instructions
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

bash
نسخ الكود
git clone <repository_url>
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
نسخ الكود
cd Investigate-a-Dataset-master
Open the Jupyter notebook:

bash
نسخ الكود
jupyter notebook
Once Jupyter opens in your browser, open the Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb notebook.

How to Run the Project
Open the Jupyter notebook as explained above.
Ensure all the necessary libraries are installed.
Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to perform the analysis and visualize the data.
Output
The notebook will include the analysis in markdown and code cells.
Visualizations will be generated with matplotlib or seaborn.
Key insights will be displayed in the notebook as well.
Exporting the Notebook
You can export your Jupyter notebook to various formats, such as HTML or PDF:

To HTML:

bash
نسخ الكود
jupyter nbconvert --to html Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb
To PDF (requires Pandoc and LaTeX):

bash
نسخ الكود
jupyter nbconvert --to pdf Investigate_a_Dataset.ipynb
Troubleshooting
Missing Module: If you encounter a missing module error, install it using pip install <module_name>.
Pandoc Missing: If you're trying to convert to PDF and encounter a PandocMissing error, make sure you have Pandoc installed. You can download it from here.
LaTeX Missing: If converting to PDF fails due to missing LaTeX, you can install MiKTeX for Windows from here.
